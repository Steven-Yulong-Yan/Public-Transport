# Public Transport Network

This project involves modelling a public transportation network. The transportation network involves:

* **Passengers** - who travel in the network
* **PublicTransports** - vehicles which the passengers travel on
* **Stops** - which the vehicles stop at, and which the passengers travel to/from
* **Routes** - which vehicles travel along. Routes are effectively a collection of multiple stops
* **Exceptions** - for when things go wrong in the network
